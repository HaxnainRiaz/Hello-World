The Bank Management System is a C++ project designed to manage bank operations efficiently using advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This system is implemented with a doubly linked list, allowing seamless management of bank customers and their details.

Features

Add Customer:

Insert new customer details into the system.

Ensure quick and efficient data storage using a doubly linked list.

Delete Customer:

Remove customer details from the system.

Maintain data integrity with minimal overhead.

Update Customer Details:

Modify existing customer information.

Navigate easily through the list to locate and update specific records.

Search Customer:

Search for customer details by name or account number.

Implemented with efficient traversal algorithms.

Display All Customers:

Print the list of all customers in a structured format.

Display details in both forward and reverse order using the doubly linked list.

Transaction Management:

Record and update deposit and withdrawal transactions.

Keep track of account balances dynamically.

Doubly Linked List Usage

The system uses a doubly linked list as the core data structure, offering:

Efficient insertion and deletion of customer records from both ends of the list.

Easy bidirectional traversal for searching and displaying customer data.

Dynamic memory management to accommodate varying data sizes.

Key Files

main.cpp: Contains the main function and program logic.

customer.h: Defines the customer structure and data fields.

doubly_linked_list.h: Implements the doubly linked list operations.

How to Run

Requirements:

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Visual Studio).

Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

Steps:

Clone or download the project files.

Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example:

g++ main.cpp -o BankManagementSystem

Run the executable:

./BankManagementSystem

Future Enhancements

Integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.

Add database support for persistent storage of customer details.

Implement more advanced DSA concepts, such as AVL trees, for faster data access.

Include enhanced security features, such as password protection and encryption.
